Staking Basics</h2><p>When you stake $KRK tokens, you&#39;re not simply locking them away - you&#39;re acquiring a <strong>percentage claim</strong> on the entire token supply. This works differently than traditional staking:</p><ul><li><strong>Fixed Percentage:</strong> Your stake represents X% of all existing $KRK tokens</li><li><strong>Dynamic Value:</strong> As new tokens are minted (common occurrence), your claim automatically applies to the new total supply</li><li><strong>Limited Capacity:</strong> Only 20% of all $KRK can be staked at any time</li></ul><p class="warning">Example: Staking 1% of the initial 1M supply (10,000 $KRK) becomes 1% of 2M supply (20,000 $KRK) after expansion</p></div><div class="concept-block"><h2>2. Harberger Tax Mechanism</h2><p>Inspired by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harberger_tax" target="_blank">Harberger tax concept</a> but adapted for crypto:</p><ul><li><strong>Traditional Model:</strong> Owners self-assess property value and pay tax accordingly</li><li><strong>Kraiken Adaptation:</strong> Stakers choose tax <em>rates</em> instead of values, creating a competitive market for positions</li></ul><p>This system achieves three key goals:</p><ol><li><strong>Market Efficiency:</strong> Positions flow to those willing to pay highest maintenance costs</li><li><strong>Anti-Hoarding:</strong> Low-tax positions get replaced, preventing permanent control</li><li><strong>Protocol Funding:</strong> Collected taxes finance ongoing development</li></ol></div><div class="concept-block"><h2>3. Earning Potential</h2><p>Staking provides leveraged exposure to $KRK&#39;s growth through two channels:</p><h3>A. Supply Expansion</h3><p>The protocol&#39;s AI liquidity manager regularly mints new tokens to:</p><ul><li>Maintain exchange liquidity</li><li>Fund ecosystem development</li><li>Respond to market demand</li></ul><p>Your staked percentage automatically applies to the new larger supply. Regular holders only benefit from price changes - stakers gain from both price <em>and</em> supply growth.</p><h3>B. Position Protection</h3><p>By choosing optimal tax rates, you can:</p><ul><li>Maintain your percentage through market cycles</li><li>Compound earnings through repeated staking</li><li>Outpace simple token holding returns</li></ul></div><div class="concept-block"><h2>4. Position Security</h2><p>While others can replace your position, crucial protections exist:</p><ul><li><strong>Full Principal Return:</strong> If replaced, you receive all unstaxed $KRK immediately</li><li><strong>Three-Day Grace Period:</strong> New positions must pay minimum 3 days&#39; tax upfront</li><li><strong>Rate Transparency:</strong> All positions display current tax rates for informed decisions</li></ul><p class="warning">Key Insight: Losing a position means forfeiting <em>future</em> earnings from that stake, not existing tokens</p></div><div class="concept-block"><h2>5. Strategic Considerations</h2><p>Successful staking requires balancing:</p><ul><li><strong>Tax Rate Selection:</strong> Higher rates protect positions but reduce net returns</li><li><strong>Market Monitoring:</strong> Track competing stakers&#39; tax rates</li><li><strong>Supply Forecasts:</strong> Anticipate minting events through protocol announcements</li></ul><p>Example Strategy: Use medium tax rates (5-15% daily) during high-growth periods to balance protection and returns</p></div>',5))}});export{p as default};
