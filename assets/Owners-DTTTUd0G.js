Owners earn earn a share of new token purchases.</p><br><p> In exchange for that benefit owners have to pay a self-assessed tax. At any time, another token holder who agrees to pay a higher tax can buyout lower-tax owner slots. This creates a fair and dynamic market for owner slots.</p><h2 id="second">Stake</h2><p>You need to stake $HARB tokens to become an owner. The more tokens you stake, the more owner slots you can get. How many slots you can claim depends on the percentage of tokens you own compared to the total supply.</p><h3>Owner Slots </h3><p> Only 20% of the total $HARB supply can be staked at any time. This limit helps keep the market competitive. This 20% equals 20,000 owner slots. Meaning 0.001% of protocol ownership gives 1 owner slot. </p><br><p>Example: Alice stakes 10 $HARB. The current total supply sits at 1000 $HARB. In exchange she gets 1,000 owner slots as she holds 1% of the current total supply. </p><h3>Minimum Stake Amount</h3><p>A minimum stake amount is required due to smart contract limits. Initially, this will be low so anyone can become an owner. As the supply grows, so will the minimum stake. To keep the market fair, governance can adjust this rule. </p><h2 id="third">Earnings</h2><p>When more $HARB is bought than sold on Uniswap (causing the price to go up), extra $HARB tokens are automatically minted to increase the pool’s liquidity and the market cap of Harberg (See Tokenomics). 20% of these newly minted tokens are distributed to all owners based on the number of slots they hold.</p><br><p>Example: Alice holds 1,000 owner slots (1% ownership). This means she earns 1% of all newly minted $HARB tokens for as long as she holds her owner slots.</p><h2 id="fourth">Owner Tax</h2><p>To balance the system owners pay a self-assessed tax on their position to retain the exclusive benefit of extra earnings. This tax is sent directly to $HARB holders - no fee is taken.</p><h3>Tax Rates</h3><p>Owners can choose from 30 tax rates, starting at 0.00274% per day and going up to 26.575% per day. The rates follow an exponential curve to make it harder for new owners to slightly increase the tax and take over an existing owner’s position.</p><h3>Floor Tax</h3><p>The floor tax is the minimum tax a new owner must pay to claim owner slots.</p><br><p>Example: If Alice wants to claim owner slots but they’re already taken, she must pay the floor tax to replace owners paying a lower tax than the floor tax.</p><h3>Pre-Tax</h3><p>The pre-tax is a safety feature for holders and owners. It stops frequent position changes and gives holders some passive income upfront.</p><h3> TAP Pool </h3><p> @johba </p><h3> Tax Actions </h3><p>Owners can interact with the tax mechanism in two ways: they can change the tax rate based on market conditions or token performance, and they can pay the tax at any time to reduce the taxable amount.</p><br><p>Example: If an owner has 100 HARB of value in their position, a 1% daily tax equals 1 HARB per day. After paying the tax, the taxable amount drops to 99 HARB. On the next day, the 1% tax will be 0.99 HARB instead of 1 HARB.</p><h2 id="fifth">Unstake</h2><p>Owners can unstake their position and owner slots whenever they want. When they do, they pay any unpaid tax and collect their earnings.</p><h2 id="sixth">Buyout</h2><p>A key feature of the market is the ability to buy out owner slots from existing owners. Allowing anyone to claim them even when all slots are taken.</p><h3> Buyer </h3><p>If a holder wants to become an owner but all slots are claimed, they can pay a higher tax to take over a slot (see floor tax).</p><h3> Seller </h3><p>If an owner is bought out, they get all their earnings and pay any unpaid taxes. They’re paid the current value of their position but lose the chance to benefit from future growth.</p><h3> Full Buyout </h3><p>Owners hold their slots in owner positions. They can have multiple positions, each with its own number of slots and tax rate. If a new owner pays a higher tax on a significant number of slots, an entire position might be bought out.</p><h3> Partial Buyout </h3><p>An owner position has multiple slots, sometimes only some slots are bought out, leaving the rest in the position.</p>',44)])))}});export{u as default};
